							<h2>Lighting Africa</h2>
							<p>Akon:</p>
							<q><i>Africa needs to be sustainable for a long time and be a crutch for the rest of world instead of the other way around,” Akon told Think Progress in a phone interview. “A stable Africa helps the world.</i></q>
							<p>Hip-hop and R&B artist Akon is a Missouri-born American of Senegalese ancestry. He has a plan to use solar energy to bring power to hundreds of millions of Africans. </p>
							<p>He created the Akon Lighting Africa (ALA) initiative in 2014, with the goal of bringing electric power to 600 million of the Africans who live without power. So far, ALA has provided solar street lamps, micro-generators, charging stations, and home kits to 14 countries — Benin, Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Guinea, Kenya, Namibia, Madagascar, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, and Sierra Leone.</p>
							<p>Due to be launched at Cityscape Abu Dhabi 2007, it is an ambitious project that will attract the highest levels of international expertise and commerce, providing a mixed-use, high-density city. The exciting programme includes a new university, the Headquarters for Abu Dhabi’s Future Energy Company,The lack of power “stopped us from doing the things we need to do,” he says. 
								“There wasn’t enough electricity to pull from,” to get Africa on par with the rest of the world developmentally, and solar was “the biggest and quickest solution.” He calls solar power a “no brainer.” special economic zones and an Innovation Center.</p>
							<p>“We want to empower the people to develop their own opportunities,” Akon said. “But before you empower people you have to educate them. So we developed the university,” which focuses on solar energy delivery and maintenance, “so they can eventually invent technology of their own.” </p>
							<p>ALA teaches citizens how solar power works and how to install arrays through an educational training program called the Solar Academy that promotes entrepreneurship, Akon said. “The involvement of the rest of the world will be key. It will have to be started by Africans, but the technology the world has to offer has to be shared.”</p>
							<p>Akon hopes to expand ALA to 11 more countries by the end of the year, and all of Africa by 2020. “We just really want to be the generation of execution and be in a position where you deliver. And when you deliver, it’s put out into the world and continued.”</p>
							<p>Power is about more than electricity. It is about political will and the ability to connect nearly 15% of the world’s population with the rest of humanity for the first time in history. Above all else, it is about personal empowerment and personal dignity for hundreds of millions of people.</p>
