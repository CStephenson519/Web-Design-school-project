							<h2>Stage 2 Innovations</h2>
							<p>Manoj Bhargava, the founder of 5-Hour Energy, has pledged to give 99 percent of his $4 billion net worth to charity. That's the opening hook of a new documentary about Bhargava called Billions in Change. </p>
							<p>It is, to be sure, fascinating that Bhargava amassed a $4 billion net worth mostly on the strength of the so-called energy shots. Likewise, it's fascinating he'd still have $40 million left, after giving away 99 percent of his fortune. 
								But if you watch Billions in Change, from an entrepreneurial perspective, you'll find yourself just as captivated by Bhargava's philosophies around innovation. Here are some highlights from the 40-minute film:</p>
							<p>The first question Bhargava asks when someone approaches him with a project. "Is it useful?" he says. "And if it's not useful, it better be entertaining. And if it's not useful or entertaining, there's only one other basket left."</p>
							<p>Bhargava used his wealth to build a philanthropic invention shop. The shop, called Stage 2 Innovations, has its own facility on 5-Hour Energy's 10-building, 25-acre base in Farmington Hills, Michigan. Its mission, says Bhargava, is to "invent stuff that makes a difference in other people's lives."</p>
							<p>specifically, Stage 2 focuses on inventions that can "help the poorer half of the world make their lives better," he says. "That's what we define as a great invention."
								Stage 2's invention philosophy is: Go big or go home. Jack Juni, a Stage 2 engineer in the film, says that Bhargava is constantly telling the engineers: "If it doesn't make a big difference, find something else to do."</p> 
							<p>Bhargava elaborates: "If it doesn't make us money but it really changes the lives of people, we're going to do it ... And if you come up with something cool that's not [useful], we don't do it. I have no interest. I don't want to be cool."</p>

							<h3>Empowering the powerless</h3>
							<p>Imagine your life without electricity. Not only would you have no cell phone, computer or television. It would be difficult to light and heat your home or prepare food without burning wood or coal. Your home would be smoky. Food storage would be impossible.
							That’s how half the world currently lives. Now imagine the difference electrical power could make to those people.</p>
							
							<h3>Our Solution: Free Electric</h3>
							<p>The Free Electric machine gives people the power to generate electricity themselves – pollution free. The machine is small, light and simple. Here’s how it works: A person pedals a hybrid bicycle. The bicycle wheel drives a flywheel, which turns a generator, which charges a battery. 
							Pedalling for one hour yields electricity for 24 hours with no utility bill, and no exhaust, no waste.</p>
							
							<h3>Water Shortages</h3>
							<p>Half the world’s population lives without adequate access to fresh, clean water for drinking, farming and sanitation. During long periods of drought, like that in California, the problem becomes more serious. But what if we could make more water?</p>
							
							<h3>Our Solution: Rain Maker</h3>
							<p>We’ve created a machine called Rain Maker. It mimics nature, turning seawater or polluted water into fresh water suitable for drinking and agriculture. Rain Maker makes more than just a little water. One machine the size of small car can make a thousand gallons per hour. Unlike other desalination systems, Rain Maker recycles its heat energy making it incredibly clean and efficient.</p>
